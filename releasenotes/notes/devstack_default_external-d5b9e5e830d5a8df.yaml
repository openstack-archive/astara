    Astara has dropped a number of legacy convenience hooks available in
    earlier releases.  The hooks complicated automation and created
    potential for mismatch of end state and the desired state.
fixes:
    - Bug `1539345 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/astara/+bug/1539345>`_
      auto added resources break interoperability
upgrade:
  - Astara will no longer automatically add the external gateway to a router.
    Previous usage was causing issues with automation tooling.
  - Astara no longer requires the external network and subnet id to be known.
    In production deployments this step was handled externally and the
    internal hooks were often disabled.
critical:
  - The devstack plugin no longer creates the external network as before and
    instead follows the setup used for reference implementation.
