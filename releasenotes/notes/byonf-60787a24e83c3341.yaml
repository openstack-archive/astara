  - Operators may now associate custom drivers and image IDs to
    tenants, via the Neutron API,  to override global configuration, providing
    support for dynamic user-provided network functions. To enable this feature,
    set ``enable_byonf=True`` in ``orchestrator.ini`` and be sure the version
    of ``astara-neutron`` loaded into Neutron supports the BYONF API.
