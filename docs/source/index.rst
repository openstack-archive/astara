Akanda
======

Akanda is the only 100% open source network virtualization platform built by
OpenStack operators for real OpenStack clouds. Originally developed by
`DreamHost <https://dreamhost.com>`_ for their OpenStack-based public cloud,
`DreamCompute <https://dreamhost.com/compute/cloud>`_, Akanda eliminates the
need for complex SDN controllers, overlays, and multiple plugins by providing
a simple integrated networking stack (routing, firewall, and load balancing via
a :ref:`virtual Service VM <appliance>`) for connecting and securing
multi-tenant OpenStack environments.
