# Astara

A service with an open plugin architecture that manages neutron advanced
services such as routers and load balancers within an OpenStack environment.

## The Name

Astara is the sanskrit word for a rug. So why name our project rug?

The original code name for this project was simply "The RUG" which was a
reference to a line from the popular film "The Big Lebowski":

**That rug really tied the room together, did it not?**

The idea is that "The Rug" really ties neutron together nicely. We felt it was
an apt description so we kept the name.
